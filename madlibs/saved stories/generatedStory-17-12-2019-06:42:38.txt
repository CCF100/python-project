Once upon a time, there were three asdf pigs. One day, their mother said, "You are all grown up and must asdf on your own." So they left to asdf their houses. The first little pig wanted only to asdf all day and quickly built his house out of asdf. The second little pig wanted to asdf and asdf all day so he agdfg his house with sdgsdaggasdgg. The third sdsadgsagdasdg pig knew the wolf lived nearby and worked hard to sdgsdagdasgadsgdasg his house out of sgdaasdgasdgasdgaddgsddsag. One day, the wolf knocked on the first pig's sgdaasdgasdasdgasdg. "Let me in or I'll sdgasdgaasdgasdgsagdgddsa your house down!" The pig didn't, so the wolf dgsadsgsdgagdsdsga down the sgdadsagdsgasaddsgadgs. The wolf knocked on the second pig's gsdadsgadsgadsgdsgdsg. "Let me in or I'll blow your gsdasadgsdgagdsasadgdsg down!" The pig didn't, so the wolf sgdasddsadgasdg down the house. Then the wolf knocked on the third asdgasdgasdgasd pig's door. "Let me in or I'll blow your house down!"
