Here he comes around the second leg. AND WOAH, AGAIN HE LOOKS weird ON NETWORK TELEVISION! This is what primetime is all about here on the network of Discovery Family. And, he presses it! He finishes with a time of 5:52 PM. Will that be enough to win? Find out on Friday when Fiona from Shrek will challenge him for the grand prize. For all of us here at MadLib, good night everyone!
