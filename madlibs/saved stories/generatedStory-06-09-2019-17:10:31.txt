Welcome everyone to Tilted Towers and the 2077 MadLib awards show. Here are the nominees for Best Rasberry at Rasberryfest 2077. First, Dwight D. Eisenhower. Next, Tom Holland RIP. And finally, Yopvid. And the winner is... Yopvid! Daniel Greene for best PUBG game of the year could not be here tonight so he recorded a message for us to see. Take a look. Winner: Hello all. Thank you, the fans, for voting. I really appreciate it. I am sorry I couldn't be there.
