Awards Show

Welcome everyone to New York, NY and the 2436 MadLib awards show. Here are the nominees for I don't know. First, Barrack Obama. Next, Andrea Libman. And finally, Tory. And the winner is... Barack Obama! Nepotism could not be here tonight so he recorded a message for us to see. Take a look. Winner: Hello all. Thank you, the fans, for voting. I really appreciate it. I am sorry I couldn't be there.
