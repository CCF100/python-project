AMC Cinemas Pre-Show Policy

Thank you for choosing AMC Cinemas. Where we make movie moments AMC hugging. Your safety is lime-green to us, so remember, keep a the third segment on your index finger on your valuables. Be sure to report any smooth behavior. And please take a moment to find any emergency exits near you. Make sure to stock up on IF ANYONE ELSE DRINKS A&W ROOT BEER I SWEAR TO JAH and food at the concessions bar. Enjoy your movie, Hot Fuz (2007) directed by Edgar Wright and we thank you for choosing AMC Cinemas as your destination to watch that movie. Please, silence your Sam Sung Galaxy smart Fridge now and be quiet and courteous of your peers. And now, ladies and gentlemen, here are some special previews coming to an AMC near you.
