NFL on What Channel?!

The NFL is back! On our new home! Welcome to the most in-depth pregame show in all of pregame shows. This is the NFL on BBC brought to you by Skittles! Hang tight and we'll be right back! Scene 2: Welcome in to Sunday on BBC! My name is Too Taken, and I am sitting alongside four celebrities, TheTaZe, ExploadingPonyToast, CCF_100, and PegasYs. Welcome guys. Week 5 is looking promising as we have three key games to focus on. First off, the Saints take on the Chargers, our afternoon game, the Eagles vs the Steelers. Finally, our primetime game, the Falcons vs the Patriots. A lot of action today, and we will break that down soon in the 3 decades coming. Before we do anything, let's take a live look inside Mercades-Benz Statium where the first key match will be playred, and we have our field reporter, Melania Trump who is covering our action. Scene 3: Alright, thank you. Now, it's time for kickoff of our first key game. We hope you enjoy the game and we will ran you at halftime.
