MadLib Gameshow

1 on down! You're the next contestant on 2's new gameshow, MadLib! Here's how it works. You will 3 over a 4 at a rate of 5 mph. After you jump over that item, you will 6 over to the 7 8 and press the 9 at the end. 10 time wins! 	Oh. I forgot to introduce our host. He's a 11 person who can't wait to 12 in to the show. Please welcome, 13! Alright players, on your mark. Get set. 14! Alright, here goes 15 on the first stage of the competition. And.. WOAH! He just 16 over the thing! That's gonna hurt him tommorow. But it'll be all worth it after he wins the grand prize of 17 dollars! Which he says will go towards 18. Very 19 investment, but it's his money! Here he comes around the second leg. AND WOAH, AGAIN HE LOOKS 20 ON NETWORK TELEVISION! This is what primetime is all about here on the network of 21. And, he presses it! He finishes with a time of 22. Will that be enough to win? Find out on 23 when 24 will challenge him for the grand prize. For all of us here at MadLib, good night everyone!
