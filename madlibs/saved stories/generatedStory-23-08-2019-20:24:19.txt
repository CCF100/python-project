Three Little Pigs

Once upon a time, there were three annoying pigs. One day, their mother said, "You are all grown up and must fly on your own." So they left to selects their houses. The first little pig wanted only to calculate all day and quickly built his house out of bats. The second little pig wanted to send and resize all day so he sent his house with computers. The third hot pig knew the wolf lived nearby and worked hard to closed his house out of DVD copies of Monty Python trade mark and the holy grail. One day, the wolf knocked on the first pig's key. "Let me in or I'll open your house down!" The pig didn't, so the wolf swiped down the button. The wolf knocked on the second pig's pig. "Let me in or I'll blow your tank down!" The pig didn't, so the wolf locked down the house. Then the wolf knocked on the third purple pig's door. "Let me in or I'll blow your house down!" The little pig didn't, so the wolf meowed and yelled.He could not blow the house down. All the pigs went to live in the dab house and they all read happily ever after.
