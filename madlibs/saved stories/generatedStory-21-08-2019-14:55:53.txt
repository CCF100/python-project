Three Little Pigs

Once upon a time, there were three Smart pigs. One day, their mother said, "You are all grown up and must Run on your own." So they left to Swim their houses. The first little pig wanted only to Copy all day and quickly built his house out of Pencils. The second little pig wanted to Type and Drink all day so he Swam his house with Apples. The third Funny pig knew the wolf lived nearby and worked hard to Jump his house out of Bottles. One day, the wolf knocked on the first pig's School. "Let me in or I'll Learn your house down!" The pig didn't, so the wolf Learned down the Computer. The wolf knocked on the second pig's Juice. "Let me in or I'll blow your Pencil down!" The pig didn't, so the wolf Ran down the house. Then the wolf knocked on the third Hairy pig's door. "Let me in or I'll blow your house down!" The little pig didn't, so the wolf Jumped and Poured.He could not blow the house down. All the pigs went to live in the Pear house and they all Ate happily ever after.
