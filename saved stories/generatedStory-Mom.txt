Once upon a time, there were three pretty pigs. One day, their mother said, "You are all grown up and must ran on your own." So they left to liked their houses. The first little pig wanted only to festered all day and quickly built his house out of girls. The second little pig wanted to tossed and acted all day so he swam his house with boys. The third funky pig knew the wolf lived nearby and worked hard to made his house out of dogs. One day, the wolf knocked on the first pig's cat. "Let me in or I'll eat your house down!" The pig didn't, so the wolf ate down the candle. The wolf knocked on the second pig's chair. "Let me in or I'll blow your book down!" The pig didn't, so the wolf read down the house. Then the wolf knocked on the third smelly pig's door. "Let me in or I'll blow your house down!" The little pig didn't, so the wolf sat and saw.He could not blow the house down. All the pigs went to live in the chair house and they all looked happily ever after.
